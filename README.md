# discaml

A work-in-progress discord bot library written (as a learning project) in OCaml.

# Requirements

- ocaml-websocket
- lwt
- yojson

# Contributing

I am but an OCaml beginner, so I cannot guarantee this code would ever be in
a nice enough state to warrant outside contributions (let alone whether I would
understand them well). But other people are always more than welcome to pitch
in!
